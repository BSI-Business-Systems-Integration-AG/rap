The pom.xml in this project helps to assemble the .war files of the 
RAP demo projects. As a default it uses the p2 repositories that are 
created from the nightly RAP and RAP incubator builds (see below).

  mvn -e clean install

At the moment it generates three .war files that can be deployed in 
any web container: controlsdemo.war, rapdemo.war, workbenchdemo.war.

The RAP Examples Demo requires bundles from additional projects. See
below for instructions on how to add them to the .war files.

Changing the default p2 repositories
************************************

The default build uses the nightly build from the RAP Runtime project,
the nightly build of the RAP Incubator projects, and the last stable
Simultaneous Release repository. This default behaviour can be changed
by setting the following properties

  rap-repository, 
  rap-incubator-repository, and 
  eclipse-simultaneous-release-repository

Example with RAP 2.2M3 and RAP Incubator builds for 2.2 /nightly using the
Kepler Simultaneous Release:

  mvn -e \
      -Drap-repository=http://download.eclipse.org/rt/rap/2.2/M3-20131111-1653/ \
      -Drap-incubator-repository=http://download.eclipse.org/rt/rap/incubator/nightly/ \
      -Declipse-simultaneous-release-repository=http://download.eclipse.org/releases/kepler/ \
      clean install

Adding additional pre-built bundles to .war files
*************************************************

(1) Copy the bundles into the project directory 
    /org.eclipse.rap.examples.build/localrepo/plugins
(2) Run the Ant build "RAP Examples - local p2 repo build" from within
    Eclipse (/org.eclipse.rap.examples.build/localrepo/build.xml)
(3) Add the new bundle to the feature.xml that describes the content of
    your .war file.
(4) Ensure that the appropriate start-levels are set in the .product
    file of your .war product.
(5) Run the standard Tycho/Maven build in project root.
